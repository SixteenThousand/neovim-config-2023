# My Neovim Configuration

Just my (fairly lightweight) configuration for the neovim, the
highly-extensible, terminal based code editor.

## Interesting features
- A session manager
- A colour scheme picker
- Way too many remaps


## Planned Changes
 - Add LSP support (started with some success!)
 - Add autoformatting (most likely using Prettier, or just existing vim tools)
to automatically narrow text to be 80 characters wide
 - Make splits open vertically by default
 - Make terminal windows (see `terminal_stuff.lua`) be more narrow by default
 - Stop the session manager throwing window-id errors (on hiatus; looks like the
 APIs my pop-ups are based on is quite unstable)
 - Integrate quickfix list into my workflow (will likely require new remaps)
 - Make Fern show hidden items by default
 - Make function that automatically opens a relevant REPL
 - Make telescope picker to look through files of a project or just the files in
 the current buffer's main directory
